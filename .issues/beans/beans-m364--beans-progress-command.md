Add `beans progress` command to show a summary of work status.

## Behavior

- Shows counts by status (e.g., "5 in-progress, 12 todo, 8 completed")
- Could show a simple progress bar
- Optional: filter by milestone/epic to see progress on specific initiatives

## Example

```bash
beans progress
# Output:
# In Progress: 2
# Todo: 15  
# Completed: 23
# Scrapped: 3
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 57% complete
```
