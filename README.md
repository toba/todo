## Fork Enhancements

This is a fork of [hmans/beans](https://github.com/hmans/beans) with the following TUI improvements:

- **Substring filter** — `/` uses contiguous substring matching instead of fuzzy matching, for more predictable results
- **Sort picker** — `o` to sort by status/priority (default), creation date, or last updated
- **Deep search** — `//` to search across bean titles, IDs, and body content
- **Configurable editor** — set `editor` in `.todo.yml` to use a custom editor (supports multi-word commands like `code --wait` and relative paths)

**Beans is an issue tracker for you, your team, and your coding agents.** Instead of tracking tasks in a separate application, Beans stores them right alongside your code. You can use the `beans` CLI to interact with your tasks, but more importantly, so can your favorite coding agent!

This gives your robot friends a juicy upgrade: now they get a complete view of your project, make suggestions for what to work on next, track their progress, create bug issues for problems they find, and more.

You've been programming all your life; now you get to be a product manager. Let's go! 🚀

## Announcement Trailer ✨

## Stability Warning ⚠️

Beans is still under heavy development, and its features and APIs may still change significantly. If you decide to use it now, please follow the release notes closely.

Since Beans emits its own prompt instructions for your coding agent, most changes will "just work"; but sometimes, we modify the schema of the underlying data files, which may require some manual migration steps. If you get caught by one of these changes, your agent will often be able to migrate your data for you:

```
The Beans data format has changed. Please migrate this project's beans to the new format.
```

## Features

- **Track tasks, bugs, features**, and more right alongside your code.
- **Plain old Markdown files** stored in a `.issues` directory in your project. Easy to version control, readable and editable by humans and machines alike!
- Use the `beans` CLI to create, list, view, update, and archive beans; but more importantly, **let your coding agent do it for you**!
- **Supercharge your robot friend** with full context about your project and its open tasks. A built-in **GraphQL query engine** allows your agent to get exactly the information it needs, keeping token use to a minimum.
- **Project memory**: Completed beans are archived and serve as project memory that your coding agent can query for context about past work.
- A beautiful **built-in** TUI for browsing and managing your beans from the terminal.
- Generates a **Markdown roadmap document** for your project from your data.

## Installation

We'll need to do three things:

1. Install the `beans` CLI tool.
2. Configure your project to use it.
3. Configure your coding agent to interact with it.

Either download Beans from the [Releases section](https://github.com/toba/todo/releases), or install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install toba/todo/todo
```

Alternatively, install directly via Go:

```bash
go install github.com/toba/todo@latest
```

## Configure Your Project

Inside the root directory of your project, run:

```bash
beans init
```

This will create a `.issues/` directory and a `.todo.yml` configuration file at the project root. All of it is meant to be tracked in your version control system.

From this point onward, you can interact with your Beans through the `beans` CLI. To get a list of available commands:

```bash
beans help
```

But more importantly, you'll want to get your coding agent set up to use it. Let's dive in!

## Agent Configuration

The most basic way to teach your agent about Beans is to simply add the following instruction to your `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent file:

```
**IMPORTANT**: before you do anything else, run the `beans prime` command and heed its output.
```

Some agents provide mechanisms to automate this step:

### Claude Code

An official Beans plugin for Claude is in the works, but for the time being, please manually add the following hooks to your project's `.claude/settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "beans prime" }] }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "beans prime" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

### OpenCode

Beans integrates with OpenCode via a plugin that injects task context into your sessions. To set it up, **copy the plugin** from [`.opencode/plugin/beans-prime.ts`](.opencode/plugin/beans-prime.ts) to your project's `.opencode/plugin/` directory (or `~/.opencode/plugin/` for global availability across all projects).

## Usage Hints

As a human, you can get an overview of the CLI's functionalities by running:

```bash
beans help
```

You might specifically be interested in the interactive TUI:

```bash
beans tui
```

### Example Workflows

**But the real power of Beans** comes from letting your coding agent manage your tasks for you.

Assuming you have integrated Beans into your coding agent correctly, it will already know how to create and manage beans for you. You can use the usual assortment of natural language inquiries. If you've just
added Beans to an existing project, you could try asking your agent to identify potential tasks and create beans for them:

```
Are there any tasks we should be tracking for this project? If so, please create beans for them.
```

If you already have some beans available, you can ask your agent to recommend what to work on next:

```
What should we work on next?
```

You can also specifically ask it to start working on a particular bean:

```
It's time to tackle myproj-123.
```

Consider that your agent will be just as capable to deal with beans as it is with code, so how about using it to quickly restructure your tasks?

```
Please inspect this project's beans and reorganize them into epics. Also please create 2-3 milestones to group these epics in a meaningful way.
```

You can also add Beans-specific instructions to your `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` or equivalent file, for example:

```
When making a commit, include the relevant bean IDs in the commit message
```

## Extensions

Beans supports extensions — external tools that sync or integrate beans with other systems (e.g., ClickUp, Jira, Linear). The coupling is intentionally loose: extensions import beans for struct awareness, while beans itself has no knowledge of any specific extension.

### Per-Bean Data

Extensions store per-bean metadata under `extensions.<name>` in bean frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Fix login bug
status: todo
extensions:
  clickup:
    task_id: "868h4hd05"
    synced_at: "2026-01-18T00:07:02Z"
  jira:
    issue_key: "PROJ-123"
---
```

This data is readable and writable via the GraphQL API:

```graphql
# Read extension data
{ bean(id: "bean-abc") { extensions { name data } } }

# Write extension data
mutation { setExtensionData(id: "bean-abc", name: "clickup", data: { task_id: "xyz" }) { id } }

# Remove extension data
mutation { removeExtensionData(id: "bean-abc", name: "clickup") { id } }

# Filter by extension
{ beans(filter: { hasExtension: "clickup" }) { id title } }
{ beans(filter: { extensionStale: "clickup" }) { id title } }
```

### Extension Configuration

Extensions can store project-level config under `extensions.<name>` in `.todo.yml`:

```yaml
beans:
  prefix: proj-
extensions:
  clickup:
    list_id: "123456"
    status_mapping:
      todo: "to do"
      in-progress: "in progress"
  jira:
    project_key: "PROJ"
```

### Building an Extension

Extensions are standalone programs that shell out to the `beans` CLI (or use the GraphQL API directly). A typical extension:

1. Reads its config from `.todo.yml` (under `extensions.<name>`)
2. Queries beans via `beans query --json '{ beans(filter: { extensionStale: "myext" }) { ... } }'`
3. Syncs data with the external system
4. Writes back via `beans query 'mutation { setExtensionData(...) { id } }'`

Go extensions can import `github.com/toba/todo/internal/bean` for struct conformance when parsing `beans` CLI JSON output, but this is optional — any language that can call the CLI or speak GraphQL works.
